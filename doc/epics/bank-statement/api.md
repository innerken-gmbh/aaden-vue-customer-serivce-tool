# Finance Reconciliation Module API

Scope: io.aaden.cloud.domain.cloud.finance.reconciliation.*

Notes

- CORS: All controllers use @CrossOrigin.
- Methods: Only GET and POST are used.
- Dates: ISO-8601 (e.g., 2025-01-31).
- File uploads: multipart/form-data. Single file part name: file; batch: files.
- DTOs only; no Map responses.

Business Logic (Short)

- Company: Create companies and maintain multiple department heads per company.
- Account: Each company can have multiple reconciliation bank accounts.
- Statement: Upload a bank statement PDF for an account. If the uploaded statement’s date range overlaps existing ones,
  the old statements (and their transactions) in the overlap are replaced. The PDF is stored and parsed by AI to create
  structured transactions.
- Transaction: Each parsed transaction belongs to a statement and includes metadata (name, description, date, amount,
  transactionType INCOME/OUTCOME, expenseType for OUTCOME, optional department head). Users can attach supporting
  files to transactions (single or batch). Initial submissionStatus is derived during AI parsing: if needToSubmitFile=false then NOT_REQUIRED; otherwise WAITING.

3) BankStatementController

- Base path: /recon/statement

Endpoints

- GET /recon/statement/list
  Query:
    - accountId: Long (required)
      Response: List<BankStatementDTO>
    - id: Long
    - accountId: Long
    - name: String
    - description: String?
    - startDate: LocalDate
    - endDate: LocalDate
    - fileUrl: String

      Parts:
    - file: MultipartFile (required)
      Response: BankStatementDTO
      Behavior:
    - Stores the PDF to S3 and triggers AI parsing to extract transactions.
    - The statement's name is generated by AI based on account info and the derived date range; client should not pass a name.
    - The statement's startDate/endDate are derived from parsed transactions (min/max date).
    - For de-duplication: the MD5 of the uploaded statement file is stored; if a statement with the same MD5 already exists for the account, the existing statement is returned without re-processing.
    - Existing statements that overlap the derived date range for the same account are replaced along with their transactions.

- GET /recon/statement/export
  Query:
    - statementId: Long (required)
      Response: application/zip (attachment)
      Behavior:
    - Returns a ZIP named "statement#<id>.zip" with structure:
        - transactions.xlsx: All transactions with columns (id, date, name, amount, type, expenseType, tag, attachmentFileName).
        - income/ -> DD_MM_YYYY_name_amount.pdf per INCOME transaction.
        - outcome/management/ -> DD_MM_YYYY_name_amount.pdf for OUTCOME with MANAGEMENT (default bucket when unspecified).
        - outcome/production/ -> DD_MM_YYYY_name_amount.pdf for OUTCOME with PRODUCTION.
    - Only transactions with an attached file (fileUrl) are included as PDF entries; transactions without attachments are omitted.

    - AI sees all uploaded files and eligible statement transactions to propose matches.
    - MD5 cache: reuses previous AI results for identical file content.

## Change Log

- 2025-10-26 15:40
    - Added categoryNote field throughout reconciliation:
        - BankTransaction entity and persistence layer
        - BankTransactionDTO and BankTransactionSaveDTO
        - TransactionAttachmentAIPreviewItemDTO
        - AttachmentAnalysis cache
    - Batch upload preview (POST /recon/transaction/batch-upload-attachments) now only considers transactions with submissionStatus in [WAITING, INVALID_CONTENT].
    - AI preview behavior updated to include categoryNote with special rule: if matched transaction is INCOME and category is 营业收入, append invoice number as 营业收入Rn.<编号> when identifiable.
